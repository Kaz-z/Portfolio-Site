## Removing distractions from your salah ðŸ•Œ
In today's fast-paced world, maintaining focus and serenity during salah (prayer) moments can be challenging due to various distractions. Muslims gather in masjids (mosques) to perform Salah together, seeking spiritual connection and closeness to Allah (God). This practice is not only a religious obligation but also a moment of peace and reflection for many.

## The Problem ðŸ¤”
The main problem identified here is the intrusion of the digital world into this sacred space and time. Mobile phones, with their constant notifications, calls, and alerts, pose a significant distraction. Not only do these interruptions affect the individual's concentration and spiritual engagement during Salah, but they also disturb the collective tranquility of the congregation. The fear of one's phone causing such a disturbance adds an additional layer of anxiety, further detracting from the spiritual experience.

## Solution ðŸ’¡
**JummahMode** presents a technology-driven solution to this modern problem. It is a mobile app designed to automatically silence users' phones upon entering a masjid. This feature ensures that digital distractions are minimized, allowing individuals to fully immerse themselves in prayer and spiritual reflection without the need to physically check or manage their devices.

The app is in a POC stage. To view the proposal click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19VdflAA2pU0uCnqPid2_jdicrGyhZ5dVWGv12KIMUuQ/edit?usp=sharing)
